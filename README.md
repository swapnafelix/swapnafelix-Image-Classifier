Image-Classifier
In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. 
You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower 
your camera is looking at. In practice, you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in
your application. We'll be using this dataset of 102 flower categories.

When you've completed this project, you'll have an application that can be trained on any
set of labelled images. Here your network will be learning about flowers and end up as a command line application.
